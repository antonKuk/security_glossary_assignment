 * **Confidentiality** - to restrict access to users data with no permissions. Any user should have only necessary permissions for his/her scope (same as "never trust user" principle). This implements password strengths checking forms, double authentication, CAPTCHA, out-of-band authentication and more
 * **Integrity** - to make sure that user's data is safe and cannot be changed or deleted by anybody with no permissions. This connects with "simple and clean are more secure" principle. Usually open source systems, combined of small modules  are more stable and secure than proprietary, bulky and hard to maintain systems (for example Linux or git systems)
 * **Availability** - to make data and functionality available to authorized users at any time, 24/7 if possible (for example google platform)
