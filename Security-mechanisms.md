### common web security techniques
* Reject Unexpected Form Input

* Encode HTML Output

* Bind Parameters for Database Queries

* Authenticate Users Safely

* Protect Data in Transit

* Protect User Sessions


### Common security measures
good network security system uses a combination of different types of network security tools as a layered defense system
* firewalls (software and/or hardware)
* policies for email and browser usage, also for remote access
* antivirus and monitoring software
* strong unique passwords, keeping them in safe place and changing them periodically
* HTTPS protocols over HTTP
* encryption and signatures where necessary
* VPN and proxy servers
* critical software updates




 * **Digital Signature** - this mechanism is used to validate the authenticity and integrity of anything digital. They use public key cryptography, which generates two linked pair of keys, one private and one public. The creator of the digital signature uses a private key to encrypt the data, while the signer uses a public key to decrypt the data.

 * **Encipherment** - Through applying mathematical calculations and algorithms, data is transformed into form which is no longer readable. The data is covered and hidden. This is achieved through Cryptography and Encipherment. Depending on which algorithm is used for encipherment, the level of data encryption changes. 

 * **Access Control** - This mechanism ensures that data which is being send cannot be attended to without permission. A number of different techniques can be used such as passwords, firewalls, or adding a PIN to the data.
