* ### multi-factor authentication
    Verifying identity with two or more independent sources. For example ATMâ€™s: a card (physical token) and a PIN (something known)

* ### bio-metrics
    Documented person's physical attributes, used in verification (scanner and appropriate software required)
* ### out of band authentication (OOB)
    Utilizing separate channels. For example in order to login to Steam or PayPal account user has to receive an access code, sent to his/her mobile device
* ### token authentication
   Utilizing magnetic card or dongle. Examples: efpost card, RF-ID chip
* ### transaction authentication
   To compare user's current transactions with known data about user in order to find possible security warnings and unusual activities. This is used by all banks. Also similar user's online behavior analysis are widely used on many platforms (Facebook, YouTube etc) 
* ### web security authentication
  CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart. Good protection against spam, bots or DOS attacks. Question or challenge that computers are unable to deal with and easy to answer for humans, an image or a bunch of distorted letters. Cons: can be annoying and difficult for some people,  consumes your time: 2-3 sec per site. Overall, A CAPTCHA can reduce your website usability and accessibility

* ### Cryptographic Key
   A string of characters that are used in a cryptographic algorithm, which is necessary for the encryption and decryption of select data. When the data being secured is encrypted, the original data is altered so that it cannot be deciphered by the user until they have the right cryptographic key to decrypt it.

* ### Encryption
   Converts data into code. Encryption makes the code impossible to decipher when the data has been converted in the encryption algorithm. The original code needs the right key to decrypt it and convert it back to its original form. 

* ### Keylogger
   Software that records each keystroke made by the user. This can be used by cybercriminals to obtain user passwords and other information to get access to places that are deemed secure and private.

* ### Spyware
   This kind of malware observes the user's activity without the user's awareness. It may be able to monitor the user, collect keystrokes as well as gain access to certain data such as login information, potentially financial data and account information. This is also called data harvesting

* ### Rootkit
   Through this malware, the cybercriminal gains access to remotely control the computer of the user. One reason why this malware is so damaging is that it is hard to detect and may therefore live on your computer for a long time
* ### Personal data
"Any information that can be used directly or indirectly to identify an individual.
Examples: names, photos, emails, credit cards details, IP addresses, as well as factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of a natural person."
